Although the NUCs came with VS Code Studio pre-installed, I personally like Notepad++ a little better 
so I decided to download and use that editor until such time as VS Code seems like a better option.

Following the "Install Vagrant" section on Vagrant's website, I utilized the binary package distribution
method of installation as opposed to compiling it from the source since I am more familiar with the binary
package method. I selected the AMD64 Version 2.3.7 binary download for Windows sinces I knew that package
is compatible with the NUC I am using. The binary is installed at C:\HashiCorp\Vagrant\bin\vagrant.exe, 
which I located by using the PowerShell command "get-command vagrant" which is equivalent to the bash
command "which."
